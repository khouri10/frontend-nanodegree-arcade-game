# Frogger Game by Marcel

## How to play
Use the arrows to move the player. Your goal is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of bugs, that moves at a random speed range. Once you reach the water you move to the next level, wich makes the bugs move at a higher speed range. If you collide, it's game over and you return level 1. 
So, which level can you reach?
